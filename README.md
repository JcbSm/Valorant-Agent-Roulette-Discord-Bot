# Valorant - Agent Roulette
Here - A bot to aid you and your pals in making interesting Valorant custom games, unrated team comps or even competitive - if you will.

---
## The Concept
You, and whoever joins you, join together to pick eachothers agents for a valorant game. To begin with, you each tell the bot which agents you have available to pick at the start of a game. This list of agents is then passed to another player, on either team, and they will pick for you the agent you will play.

Each player is given 60 seconds to select which agents they have, and 30 seconds to pick the agent for another person. If they fail to do the latter, a random agent will be picked from the list.

## Invite the bot
Either invite the bot to your server using [this link](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=926082464508674060&permissions=277025769536&scope=bot%20applications.commands), or you can clone the repo and run it yourself if you know what you're doing :P

## How it works
Execute the command '/start'

Here you will be met with the UI:

You can configure the map pool, reroll the map, kick people and start/exit the process.

If you are playing as a team of 5, and just want to pick eachother agents, make sure you all join the same team to avoid duplicate agents being selected. As two of the same agent cannot be picked for one particular team.

Once everyone's joined and map has been selected, the bot will DM each player with the following message, where they must select which agents they have unlocked.

After every player has confirmed their available agents, or ran out of time, one by one, each player will select an agent for another.

Once everyone's selected, you can begin! :D

Then everyone can see who's playing as who
